# ManyToMany-Relationship

## I had some trouble to understand how manytomany relationship works so i read a lot of articles and finally i did it.

## In this project i use:
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)


## If you want test it clone repository

 Create a database in postgres with name manytomany

 In project directory use 'yarn' to download all dependencies and 'yarn typeorm migration:run' to create columns in postgres

 Run 'yarn dev:server' to server run

 Now you can use Insomnia, if u want, to send info to routes or get info for routes
